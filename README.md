# This is the code used for the bioinformatic analysis of cancer exomes and karyotypes as part of my Master'a thesis research
The file "Mitelman.py" contains the code used for the analysis of sex chromosome aberrations in male cancer karyotypes stored in the Mitelman Database of Chromosome Aberrations and Gene Fusions in Cancer.
The other scripts are parts of the bioinformatics pipeline for identifying sex chromosome numerical alterations in WXS data. they are also available in R Markdown document form on the Biomedical Research and Study Center's Rstudio server.
